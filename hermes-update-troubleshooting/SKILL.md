# Hermes Agent Self-Update Troubleshooting

On Windows, Hermes updates from the desktop app or `hermes update` both
mutate the same checkout at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\hermes-agent`.
Update evidence is **always** in:

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\logs\update.log` — full update transcript
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\.update_check` — JSON `{"behind": N, "ver": ...}`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\.update_exit_code` — last update exit code

**Diagnose from update.log FIRST** — do not theorize. `behind: 0` +
exit code 0 means the last update actually succeeded; the user may be
seeing a stale failure.

## Failure mode 1: npm EBADENGINE (the "worked before, now fails" cause)

Hermes declares an npm engine range in its package.json, e.g.
`"npm": "<11.10.0 || >=12.0.0"`. Any npm version in the **forbidden gap**
(here: 11.10 ≤ npm < 12, e.g. 11.12.1) makes every `npm install` step
fail with EBADENGINE, which cascades into web-UI build failure and
"Update partially complete — Node.js dependencies for repo root did not
refresh". Code + Python deps update; the dashboard/TUI end up mixed.

Fix (one-time, do NOT fight Hermes's own npm management):
```powershell
npm install -g npm@12          # satisfies >=12.0.0
# or downgrade into the lower window:
npm install -g npm@11.9.0
```
Verify: `npm --version`. This is why the in-app update "used to work" —
the system npm was once in-range, then got bumped into the gap.

## Failure mode 2: interactive prompt the GUI can't answer

When the checkout has local modifications, `hermes update` auto-stashes
them and prints:
```
⚠ Local changes were stashed before updating.
Restore local changes now? [Y/n]
```
- **From a CLI terminal**: the user sees the prompt and answers → update
  proceeds → succeeds. This is exactly why "CLI 更新成功".
- **From the desktop app**: there is no stdin; the update appears stuck /
  dead / failed. The user's natural conclusion is "App 更新失败".

If the user reports "app fails, CLI works" — check update.log for this
prompt. The durable fix is to clear the local modifications so no stash
is needed (`git status` clean in the checkout), or tell the user to run
`hermes update` from a terminal when local changes exist.

## Failure mode 3: state.db locked (update while app is running)

The GUI/desktop keeps `state.db` open; an update that needs to migrate
databases retries and logs "The next `hermes update` will retry" / a
concurrent-update guard ("Another Hermes update is already running
(PID ...)"). Fix: fully quit Hermes (tray + all `Hermes` processes)
before updating, and never double-trigger an update.

## Failure mode 4: ZIP-fallback update wipes the desktop build (shortcut dead)

Symptom: desktop shortcut points at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\hermes-agent\apps\desktop\release\win-unpacked\Hermes.exe`
but the file/dir is gone ("快捷方式打不开"); the update itself reported
success. Evidence trail in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\`:

- `.hermes-update-result.json` → `"message": "Update complete. Reopen
  Hermes to finish (it could not restart itself)."` `manual: true`
- `logs\desktop-update-handoff.log` tail → `desktop skipped` / no
  "relaunching desktop" line (earlier successful runs always have it)
- `logs\update.log` → "⚠ Git update failed ... → Falling back to ZIP
  download..." then "✓ Updated N items from ZIP"

Mechanism: on Windows, when `uv pip install` fails mid-update (usually
`PermissionError: another process is holding hermes.exe open`, os error
32), `hermes update` falls back to downloading a GitHub source ZIP and
replacing the checkout. That path preserves ONLY top-level
`venv/node_modules/.git/.env` — so gitignored build artifacts
(`apps/desktop/release/` incl. Hermes.exe, `apps/desktop/dist/`, and
`apps/desktop/node_modules`) get wiped. The retry then reports "desktop
skipped" (stamp check sees no source change) and never rebuilds, so the
launcher can't restart the app. Underlying trigger was hermes.exe being
held open — often a second `hermes` process/gateway still running.

Fix:
```powershell
hermes desktop --force-build --build-only
```
(~2-4 min; re-runs npm install + electron-builder, regenerates
`apps\desktop\release\win-unpacked\Hermes.exe`, shortcut works again.)
Plain `hermes desktop --build-only` (no `--force`) also rebuilds when
`release/` is missing — the stamp check only skips the build when the
artifacts already exist. Verified 2026-08-15: successful `--build-only`
rebuilt a 214 MB Hermes.exe; the app then launched (multi-process
Electron tree). Note the update flow may report exit 0 with the desktop
stage unbuilt (`desktop-update-handoff.log` shows "retry exit code: 0"
while `release/` is missing) — trust the filesystem, not the exit code.
Check nothing else is holding hermes.exe first (`Get-Process hermes`)
to avoid re-triggering the ZIP path on the next update.

## Fix ladder (in order)

1. Read `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\logs\update.log` tail — identify which
   mode you're in (EBADENGINE / stash prompt / DB lock / actually OK).
2. `npm --version` → if in a forbidden gap, `npm install -g npm@12`.
3. `git -C %LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\hermes-agent status --short` → if dirty,
   either clean it or expect the interactive prompt (use CLI, not app).
4. Make sure Hermes is fully quit, then run `hermes update` from a
   standalone PowerShell/cmd (not through the app, not through an
   agent terminal that the app spawns).
5. Verify with `.update_check` (`behind: 0`) + `tail update.log`
   ("✓ Update complete!").

## Pitfalls

- ❌ Do NOT report "update failed" from a single in-app click without
  reading update.log — `behind: 0` means it already succeeded.
- ❌ Do NOT try to patch the engine range in package.json; the project
  is repo-owned and the fix is upgrading the system npm.
- ❌ Do NOT assume the desktop app and CLI update identically — the
  stash-restore prompt is interactive and only the CLI can answer it.
- ❌ Hermes only upgrades npm inside its own managed Node install; the
  system npm (`C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd`) is left alone — that's
  the one you must fix yourself.
- The SQLite WAL-reset warning in update.log ("Hermes venv links SQLite
  ... has the WAL-reset bug → provisioning a private Python runtime")
  is auto-repaired by Hermes itself; no user action needed.
